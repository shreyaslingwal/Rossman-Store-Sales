# Rossman-Store-Sales
This project is a machine learning solution for forecasting daily sales for Rossmann  stores using historical data provided in the Kaggle Rossmann Store Sales competition. The notebook covers the entire data science pipeline including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The primary objective is to build a predictive model capable of forecasting sales while incorporating promotional campaigns, store information, holidays, and more. Models like XGBoost and Random Forest are used to tackle this time-series regression task. This project serves as a practical example of applying real-world forecasting techniques to business retail data.
